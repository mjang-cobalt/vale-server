Vale Server has a powerful extension system that doesn't require knowledge of
any programming language. Instead, it uses collections of individual
[YAML](http://yaml.org) files (or "rules") to enforce particular writing constructs.

```yaml title="HeadingPunctuation.yml"
# An example rule from the "Microsoft" style.
extends: existence
message: "Don't use end punctuation in headings."
link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/punctuation/periods
nonword: true
level: warning
scope: heading
action:
  name: edit
  params:
    - remove
    - '.?!'
tokens:
  - '[a-z0-9][.?!](?:\s|$)'
```

These collections are referred to as *styles* and are organized in a
nested folder structure at a user-specified location
(see [Configuration](/vale-server/concepts/config)). For example,

```text
styles/
├── base/
│   ├── ComplexWords.yml
│   ├── SentenceLength.yml
│   ...
├── blog/
│   ├── TechTerms.yml
│   ...
└── docs/
    ├── Branding.yml
    ...
```

where _base_, _blog_, and _docs_ are your styles that each contain certain
rules.

## Extension points

:::info Heads up!
As if v2.10.0, you can specify an array of scopes to match against:

```yaml
scope:
  - heading.h1
  - heading.h2
  - heading.h3
```
:::

The building blocks of styles are rules (YAML files ending in `.yml`), which utilize extension points to perform specific tasks.

The basic structure of a rule consists of a small header \(shown below\) followed by extension-specific arguments.

```yaml
# All rules should define the following header keys:
#
# `extends` indicates the extension point being used (see below for information
# on the possible values).
extends: existence
# `message` is shown to the user when the rule is broken.
#
# Many extension points accept format specifiers (%s), which are replaced by
# extracted values. See the exention-specific sections below for more details.
message: "Consider removing '%s'"
# `level` assigns the rule's severity.
#
# The accepted values are suggestion, warning, and error.
level: warning
# `scope` specifies where this rule should apply -- e.g., headings, sentences, etc.
#
# See the Markup section for more information on scoping.
scope: heading
# `link` gives the source for this rule.

```

The available extension points are discussed below.

### `existence`

<Existence />

### `substitution`

<Substitution />

### `occurrence`

<Occurrence />

### `repetition`

<Repetition />

### `consistency`

<Consistency />

### `conditional`

<Conditional />

### `capitalization`

<Capitalization />

### `readability`

<Readability />

### `spelling`

<Spelling />

### `sequence` (v2.3.0)

<Sequence />

## Built-in style

Vale Server comes with a single built-in style named `Vale` that implements three rules,
as described in the table below.

| Rule              | Scope  | Level   | Description                                                         |
|-------------------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Vale.Spelling`   | `text` | `error` | Spell checks text while respecting the active project's vocabulary. |
| `Vale.Terms`      | `text` | `error` | Enforces the current project's `Preferred` [vocabulary terms](/vale-server/concepts/vocab).                    |
| `Vale.Avoid`      | `text` | `error` | Enforces the current project's `Do not use` [vocabulary terms](/vale-server/concepts/vocab).                    |

## Third-party styles

Vale Server has a growing selection of pre-made styles available for download
from its [style library](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles).

## Actions

:::info Heads Up!
Rule actions are currently only supported in **Atom**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **Sublime Text 3**. Support for other clients is on the way!
:::

In addition to implementing your own rules via the available checks, you can also assign an "action" to a rule. The goal of an action is to provide a list of possible solutions for a given rule.

An action consists of a `name` and an array of `params`, and can be added to any rule definition&mdash;for example, a `spelling` rule that uses the `suggest` action:

```yaml
extends: spelling
message: "Did you really mean '%s'?"
level: error
action:
  name: suggest
  params:
    - spellings
ignore:
  - vocab.txt
```

### `suggest`

**Example Definition:**

```yaml
action:
  name: suggest
  params:
    - spellings
```

**Param Summary:**

|   NAME    |   PARAMETERS   |                              DESCRIPTION                               |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spellings`     | N/A | Returns an array of possible replacements for a misspelled word. |

`suggest` takes a single parameter (one of the options in the able above) and returns an array of possible replacements.

### `replace`

:::info Heads Up!
Rules that extend `substitution` will automatically populate the `params` array, so you can simply provide the name:

```yaml
action:
  name: replace
```
:::

**Example Definition:**

```yaml
action:
  name: replace
  params:
    - option1
    - option2
    ...
```

`replace` returns an array of user-provided replacements.

### `remove`

**Example Definition:**

```yaml
action:
  name: remove
```

`remove` will remove the matched text of any rule.

### `convert`

**Example Definition:**

```yaml
action:
  name: convert
  params:
    - simple
```

**Param Summary:**

|   NAME    |   PARAMETERS    |                              DESCRIPTION                               |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `simple`     | N/A | Return the matched text as a lowercased, space-delimited string. |

`convert` will convert the case of the matched text of any rule according to the parameter provided.

### `edit`

**Example Definition:**

```yaml
action:
  name: edit
  params:
    - remove
    - '.?!'
```

**Param Summary:**

|   NAME    |   PARAMETERS   |                              DESCRIPTION                               |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `replace`     | `string`, `string` | Replace the first parameter with the second. |
| `trim`     | `string` | Trim the first parameter from the end of the matched text. |
| `remove`     | `string` | Remove the first parameter from the both start and end of the matched text. |
| `split`     | `string`, `int` | Split the matched text on the first parameter at the index of the second parameter. |

`edit` will perform an in-place edit on the match string according to the provided parameters.
